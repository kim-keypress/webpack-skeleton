# Webpack skeleton by [keypress.be](https://keypress.be)

My goto webpack config, if I learn something about webpack that is useful for all projects it gets 
added here.

### Installation

Although getting the contents of a git repository on your local machine isn't the hardest of tasks, 
I found that cloning a full branch every time just to delete the .git folder gets annoying after a while.
Not to speak of the useless download of the full git history that it brings along with it.

It comes out that I'm not the only one thinking like that because [Rich-Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris) thought
the same about it, that why he created [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

Install degit globally `npm install -g degit` and then use it to download the webpack skeleton into a directory
`degit kim-keypress/webpack-skeleton`.

### TLDR

```
npm install -g degit
degit kim-keypress/webpack-skeleton
```
